i put the description in another place bc im dumb and dunno how to use github, but this program blinks two external leds in the portb 2 and the portb 3, one per time.
You should obviously change the delaytime to 2000 in the "#define delaytime", unless you want the leds to blink every two minutes or something, im not good at math.
20000 make it slow, but my arduino is fried and 2000 looks like a 200 miliseconds. its confusing.
